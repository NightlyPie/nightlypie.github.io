        <h2>Understanding Jekyll</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="contents">
            If you have read my last blog post, I experimented with Jekyll
            and my dumbass still didn't understand it.<br><br>

            Okay so uhhh, maybe saying "doesnt understand" is a bit of an exaggeration<br>
            I do understand Jekyll, but I guess my brain was acting up that I convinced myself that Jekyll was too
            complicated.

            <br><br>//////<br>> Making a post<br><br>

            Basically, I thought there was a command that you was supposed to do to make
            a new post.<br>
            Nope, I was stupid. You have to manually make it.<br>
            Thankfully, It wasn't really that hard<br>
            All I did was:<br>
            <mark>
                $ touch [YEAR-MONTH-DATE-TITLE].md
            </mark><br><br>
            And from there, add<br>
            <mark>

                --- <br>
                title: [TITLE]<br>
                layout: post<br>
                ---

            </mark><br>
            To the top of the markdown file you just created(Add it without the quotations)<br>

            <br><br>//////<br>> Themes<br><br>
            Let's get to the fun part: Themes.<br>
            Now I won't be having the correct informations with themes because.. Well..<br>
            I literally only spent like 30 minutes messing around with Jekyll<br><br>

            Some themes require you to fork the theme, Some themes require you to just add a line in Gemfile.<br>

            We will only be focusing on adding the Gemfile method because I don't really understand the forking method
            yet.<br><br>

            You can first start by typing:<br>
            <mark>
                gem "[THEME-NAME]"
            </mark><br>
            On Gemfile (It should be there from when you first execute the command to make a new website)
            <br><br>

            You can then do:<br>
            <mark>
                $ bundle install
            </mark><br>
            To make sure that the themes is installed so no errors occur
            <br><br>

            And then replace the "theme" part in _config.yml with your theme name.<br>
            <mark>
                theme: [THEME-NAME]
            </mark>

            <br><br>//////<br>> Conclusion<br><br>

            Jekyll is a pretty nice way to make a website.<br>
            It's really simple, and unless you're a lazy person(like me), it is going to be easy to understand.<br>
            I probably will still use my own code instead of Jekyll until I found the theme that is *PERFECT* or the
            most similiar to my current one.<br><br>
