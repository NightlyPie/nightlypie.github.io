        <h2>The experience of making this website</h2>
        <hr>
        <p class="contents">

            Making this website was such a pain. Let me tell you why.
            <br><br>//////<br><br>
            One day, I decided to wake up and said to myself<br>
            <mark>
                "Hey I should try to update my website"
            </mark><br>
            So I did try to update my website.<br>How did it go?<br>
            It went HORRIBLE.

            <br><br>//////<br><br>
            I tried out <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which is<br>
            <mark>
                "a static site generator. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner,<br> GitHub's co-founder, it is
                distributed
                under the open source MIT license."<br>
            </mark>
            That aside, The last time I tried Jekyll, It was too complicated for me<br>
            Now obviously, I have improved so I want to try out Jekyll for my website!<br>
            So I did use Jekyll. It went smoothly<br>
            Only for making the website though.

            <br><br>//////<br><br>

            The only commands I did was: <br>
            <mark>
                jekyll new nightlypie.github.io
            </mark><br>
            And that's the only thing I did. I couldn't even make a post
            because it was still too complicated for my brain<br>

            And that's where I realized I have not improved in web development

            <br><br>//////<br><br>
            So I scrapped the idea and used <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> instead.<br>
            I have some experience with Hugo because I have successfully made a few blogs with it<br>
            Except... I wanted to make a personal website instead of a blog.
            You might say<br>
            <mark>
                "Well that's easy! Just find a theme that is perfect for a personal website!"
            </mark><br>
            Well, Most of the themes is made SPECIFICALLY for blogging.<br>
            Until.. I found a theme called <a href="https://github.com/luizdepra/hugo-coder">Coder</a>.<br>

            <br><br>//////<br><br>
            It is the CLOSEST thing to what I want to make.<br>
            So I used that theme! Everything was working pretty smoothly<br>
            so I published it to GitHub<br>
            Yeah, the GitHub page did deploy... Except it didn't know which file to set as the "website"<br>
            So the only thing on the website was GitHub and an error saying "File not found"<br>
            I was pretty frustrated so I decided to take a break.

            <br><br>//////<br><br>

            I wanted to try Jekyll again because I felt like there's no way<br>
            I didn't understand Jekyll and it was just my brain acting up..<br>
            Nothing changed, I still didn't understand it

            <br><br>//////<br><br>

            So I just said<br>
            <mark>
                "F*** it. I'll just code it from scratch"
            </mark><br>
            It was pretty tricky at first because<br>
            I'm focusing on coding in Java and not HTML nor CSS.<br>
            But after about 30 minutes or so, I got the hang of it.<br>
            I uploaded it to GitHub and the GitHub page actually worked!<br>
            Implemented the blog page and now we're here.<br>

            <br><br>//////<br><br>

            Thank you so much for reading this blog. I appreciate it
            <br>very much because I'm a nobody in the internet.
            <br>I hope you have a great day, and I'll see you again on the next blog post!
