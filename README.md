Personal Website - https://nightlypie.github.io

HUGELY HUGELY inspired by a jekyll theme called "no style, please!' (blog page) and https://theevilskeleton.gitlab.io/ (motivation)

# what happened
sorry for deleting the repo! the website got glitched and i didnt have time to fix it.  
im using the old version for now until i can figure out what's wrong  
if i cant figure out what's wrong, rewrite again :D  
i'll probably just actually rewrite it in react this time lmao
