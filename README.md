Personal Website - https://nightlypie.github.io

HUGELY HUGELY inspired by a jekyll theme called "no style, please!' (blog page) and https://theevilskeleton.gitlab.io/ (motivation)

## rewrite (again) coming soon
why rewrite? the website is too hard to maintain  
just give me like a week and then another 2 weeks to make the rewrite. trying to learn nextjs while making a website is hard(yes, the website is going to be made in nextjs.. i hope)  
i'll just push minor changes instead of major for now.
